        I am from Sachse, Texas and if you have not heard of it that's okay because most people
        haven't either. There was pretty much nothing there to do when I lived there, now I think 
        they may have one bar, some fast food restaurants (Mcdonald's) and of course grocery stores, so much fun!

        After I graduated from Sachse High, mind you 
        my class was the 3rd graduating class, I went to college at Texas Tech where I recieved a BS in Animal Science.
        Everyone said Tech was a party school and they were not wrong. Between partying I played bass drum for Techs 
        marching band, The Goin' Band from Raiderland. After graduating from Tech I am became a veterinary technician
        for Dallas Veterinary Surgical Center, where I still save animal lives everyday.
