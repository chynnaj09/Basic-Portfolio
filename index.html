    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
        I am from Sachse, Texas and if you have not heard of it that's okay because most people
        haven't either. There was pretty much nothing there to do when I lived there now I think 
        they may have one bar and of course grocery stores, so much fun. 
        
        <p>
            After I graduated from Sachse High, mind you 
        my class was the 3rd graduating class, I went to college at Texas Tech where I recieved a BS in Animal Science.
        Everyone said Tech was a party school and they were not wrong. Between partying I played bass drum for Techs 
        marching band, The Goin' Band from Raiderland.
